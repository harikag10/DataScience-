# DataScience-
Data science project work
Divided the work into 3 categories

-Machine Learning - Includes all ML model creation for supervised, unsupervised learning

-Reinforcement Learning - Explored open ai gym environments for Reinforcement learning 

-Deep Learning - Includes predictions using different neural networks like CNN

 Co-authored a gitbook explaining RNN and LSTM networks - here is the link to it
