Data science project work
Divided the work into 3 categories

-Machine Learning - Includes all ML model creation for supervised, unsupervised learning
-Reinforcement Learning - Explored open ai gym environments for Reinforcement learning 
-Deep Learning - Includes predictions using different neural networks like CNN and written a notebook explaining RNN and LSTM networks
